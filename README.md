Hi there!

Iâ€™m currently immersed in learning web development and user experience. Following my computer science education, my goal is to secure an apprenticeship to further boost and enhance my skills.

I draw inspiration from the rich culture of the 80s and 90s, including movements like hip-hop, the techno scenes of Detroit and Chicago, and the advent of home computing and retro-gaming. This eclectic mix of influences not only fuels my creativity but also shapes my approach to web development and user experience.

I'm eager to bring a blend of modern expertise and a touch of nostalgia to my work. Looking forward to the exciting journey ahead!
